```{r}
#| echo: false

# NOTE: The immediately following line loads an renv environment located at the
#       nearest "top-level" directory, as marked by a `.here` file, which is
#       located by the here::here() function. This would be a useful tool if,
#       say, this template.qmd file was not located at the top-level directory.
#       Here, renv should activate automatically when this file is opened.
#renv::load(here::here())
